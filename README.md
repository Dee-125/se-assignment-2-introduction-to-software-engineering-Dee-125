Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a branch in computer science that deals with the development, design and maintainance of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the development ,designing and maintenance of software applications while  traditional programming is mostly center around the coding aspect to create a specific instruction for the computer to follow.
 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
SDLC is a layered processes involving several steps that will device the solution to a problem, design a solution to that problem, develop the solution and finally test for errors before releasing the final software product.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Analysis - this is an important stage where the information on the software requirements is taken to consideration and analysed.  
2. Design - this defines the overall architecture and the model of the software product
3. Software developing - During this phase the actual coding of the solution or rather the software product is actually carried out.
4. Software testing - testing is done in stages, an alpha test is carried out with the software development team present where they can fix bugs almost right away then the beta test where the product is given to actual users to test and give back a review or report on bugs if any.
5. Implementation - the final software product is deployed and is actually put to use by the customer.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile models are flexible and iliterative and it emphasises continuos feedback and adaptation thus allows for changes during development and the work is divided into time based sprints and is done in a set of agile teams. Well-suited for dynamic projects where requirements evolve.
Waterfall Models are sequential and rigid following distinct phases i.e planning, design, development, and testing. Through planning is carried out and each stage is done untilk completion. A scenario in which this may be applied is for large, complex project swith specific unchanging requirements.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is a systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system is known as requirements engineering. To guarantee the effective creation of a software product, the requirements engineering process entails several tasks that help in understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity simply means the software components that are been created is done so by dividing the software. The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other. 
Modularity improves maintainability as each module exists separately so if a problem occurs only the module that is having a problem is to be fixed unlike scrolling through the hundreds or thousands of lines of code to fix the problem/bug.
In terms of scalabily modules used can be reused in other systems all you would need to do is to link the new software with the module you will like to reuse. 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
a.Unit Testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.
b.Integration Testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected.
c.System Testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.
d.Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment.

Software testing helps in early defect detection and fixing them to make a more successful and good application-Software testing helps in saving the money of the developing organization by detecting defects in the early stages of the software which becomes easy and economical for the developer to redesign the module instead of detecting bugs after the complete development of the software. 
To improve the quality of a product- During software testing, an application undergoes several testing techniques to make a quality end product and the testing team tries their best by writing test cases and test scenarios to validate defect-free free applications.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Role of a Software project manager:
1.Preparing project proposals and discussing potential projects with clients and stakeholders
2.Facilitating project initiation by defining project scope and requirements, and preparing the necessary documents and requirements
3.Developing project plans and timelines to ensure the timely submission of project deliverables
4.Managing project budgets and resources to ensure the timely completion of milestones
5.Planning out the blueprints for software projects, including defining the scope, allocating resources, setting deadlines, laying out communication strategies, and indicating tests and maintenance
6.Assembling and leading the project team
7.Participating in and supervising each stage of the project

Challenges of a software project manager:

1.Changing Requirements during the development process brings challenges for the software developers. Sometimes they won’t be able to deal with changing requirements. 
 
2.Providing complete Security to the software applications is a major challenge for developers as hackers are trying each moment there to hack the software applications and steal the data. 
 
3.Sometimes Misinterpreted requirements to give rise to a problem as a result the software product fails to give the actual result to the end-users. 
 
4.Many times software developers face problems during System and Application integration leading to the failure of software projects also. 
 
5.Further Maintenance and Upgradation become a problem for software developers for some software projects. 
 
6.Adapting to the latest Technology becomes a big challenge for software developers when they don’t have sufficient experience with the latest market trends. 

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer. This involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and adapting to new hardware or software environments. Effective maintenance is crucial for extending the software’s lifespan and aligning it with evolving user needs.

Types of Maintenance Activities:
1.Corrective Maintenance: This involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system.
2.Patching: It is an emergency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management. Patching is done for corrective maintenance but it gives rise to unforeseen future errors due to lack of proper impact analysis.
3.Adaptive Maintenance: This involves modifying the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware or software, government policies, and business rules.
4.Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving functionality, performance, and reliability, and restructuring the software system to improve changeability.
5.Preventive Maintenance: This involves taking measures to prevent future problems, such as optimization, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and implementing preventive measures such as backups.

Why Software Maintenance must be performed is in order to: 
>Correct faults.
>Improve the design.
>Implement enhancements.
>Interface with other systems.
>Migrate legacy software.
>Retire software.
>Requirement of user changes.
>Run the code fast

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues that software engineers face:
1.Unethical data collection
2.Algorithimic bias
3.Weak security protection
4.Negative relationship between feature and impact
5.Open source collaboration

How software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards:
1.By acting consistently with the public interest.
2.By accepting full responsibility for their own work.
3.Moderate the interest of the developers with the public good.
4.Emsure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
